#Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm)
"""
The algorithm maintains in its local variables a sequence element 
and a counter, with the counter initially zero. 
It then processes the elements of the sequence, one at a time. 
When processing an element x, if the counter is zero, 
the algorithm stores x as its remembered sequence element and
sets the counter to one. 
Otherwise, it compares x to the stored element 
and either increments the counter (if they are equal) 
or decrements the counter (otherwise). 
At the end of this process, if the sequence has a majority, 
it will be the element stored by the algorithm. 
This can be expressed in pseudocode as the following steps:

Initialize an element m and a counter i with i = 0
For each element x of the input sequence:
    If i = 0, then assign m = x and i = 1
    else if m = x, then assign i = i + 1
    else assign i = i âˆ’ 1
Return m

Even when the input sequence has no majority, the algorithm will report one of the sequence elements as its result. However, it is possible to perform a second pass over the same input sequence in order to count the number of times the reported element occurs and determine whether it is actually a majority. This second pass is needed, as it is not possible for a sublinear-space algorithm to determine whether there exists a majority element in a single pass through the input.[3]
