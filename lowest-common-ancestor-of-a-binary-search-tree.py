# Solution 2
# Just walk down from the whole tree’s root as long as both p and q are in the same subtree (meaning their values are both smaller or both larger than root’s). This walks straight from the root to the LCA, not looking at the rest of the tree, so it’s pretty much as fast as it gets. A few ways to do it:
