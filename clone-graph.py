Note that the graph could contain cycles, for example a node could have a neighbor that points back to it. Therefore, we should use a map that records each nodeâ€™s copy to avoid infinite recursion.

# Breadth traversal2
"""
A straight forward breadth-first traversal seemed to work. But some details are still missing. For example, how do we connect the nodes of the cloned graph?
The fact that B can traverse back to A implies that the graph may contain a cycle. You must take extra care to handle this case or else your code could have an infinite loop.
